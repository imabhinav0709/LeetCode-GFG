### 📜 Problem Description

You are given the  `root`  of a  **binary tree**  that consists of exactly  `3`  nodes: the root, its left child, and its right child.

Return  `true`   *if the value of the root is equal to the  **sum**  of the values of its two children, or*  `false`  *otherwise* .

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [10,4,6]
Output: true
Explanation: The values of the root, its left child, and its right child are 10, 4, and 6, respectively.
10 is equal to 4 + 6, so we return true.

```

**Example 2:**

 ![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/04/08/graph3drawio-1.png) 

```
Input: root = [5,3,1]
Output: false
Explanation: The values of the root, its left child, and its right child are 5, 3, and 1, respectively.
5 is not equal to 3 + 1, so we return false.

```

**Constraints:**

	
- The tree consists only of the root, its left child, and its right child.
	
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
