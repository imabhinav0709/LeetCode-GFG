### 📜 Problem Description

Given the  `root`  of a binary search tree and an integer  `k` , return  `true`   *if there exist two elements in the BST such that their sum is equal to*   `k` ,  *or*   `false`   *otherwise* .

**Example 1:**

 ![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/21/sum_tree_1.jpg) 

```
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], k = 9
Output: true

```

**Example 2:**

 ![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/21/sum_tree_2.jpg) 

```
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], k = 28
Output: false

```

**Constraints:**

	
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range  `[1, 104]` .
	
- `-104 <= Node.val <= 104`
	
- `root`  is guaranteed to be a  **valid**  binary search tree.
	
- `-105 <= k <= 105`
